My State Machine:

A B G
B F H
C F B
D D C
E D A
F E A
G H E
H G D

Starting State: D

This lab was quite a challenge, the 0/1 command works properly and gives the correct results. the initial state machine is 
printed and as the change function is applied an updated version of the state machine diagram is produced using print. The 
two fucntions that gave the most difficulty was garbage and delete, garbage does not work and delete may work but can not be
tested for sure because garbage does not work. The output is "No unreachable, undeleted states found."

Other than those two functions everything else seems to work fine.
