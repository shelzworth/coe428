# coe428

This is the repository for my lab work for COE 428 Data Structures and Algorithms. In this course I learned how to design data structures using C to solve simple problems and slowly work my way up to more complex ones. During this course I learned how to use data structures to solve problems such as the Towers of Hanoi and FSM problems. Throughout this course I used merge sort, insertion sort as well as heap and stack structures.
